	-@Aiden, you can add a hidden call to print out the SalesReport.txt from Main Menu (DO NOT call it - it has been generated along the transaction => see Line 199)
	-I am happy to plug in the StreamReader codes, if you would like, after you set up the hidden option the in the Main Menu

!!!Line 20:
-Had to make Balance prop {get;set;} in VM Class instead of {get; private set;} to make FinishPurchase() work in <PurchaseMenu>
-Would rather have Balance prop {get; private set;} so that it will not be albe to be modified outside of the VendingMachine Class  - for "virtual" security reason
-Also still need to keep ReturnChange() method so that the GiveChangeLog() works within the class and keep the GiveChangeLog() private.
-Would you mind moving your codes under FinishPurchase() in <PurchaseMenu> into the VendingMachine Class?  You may move them under ReturnChange() or you can keep FinishPurchase() name in the VM class

@Aiden: In Purchabe Menu and after the change is returned, is there anyway to add a line saying "Please press ESC to return to Main Menu?"  I took me a while to figure out to get back to Main.  Thought it would be nicer to make it clear for the users.  Thank you!!!
